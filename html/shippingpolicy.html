                SHIPPING POLICY
            </h1>

            <h2>
                How does the delivery process work?
            </h2>

            <ul>
                <li> Once our system processes your order, your products are inspected thoroughly to ensure they are in a perfect condition.</li>
                <li>After they pass through the final round of quality check, they are packed and handed over to our trusted delivery partner.</li>
                <li>Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the earliest possiblity. In case, they are unable to reach your provided address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the issue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
                How are items packaged?
            </h2>

            <p>
                We are committed to sustainability in our packaging while ensuring the safety of the orders dispatched. Our Nykaa cardboard outer box is eco friendly and made from 100% recycled paper. Where feasible, we use paper-fillers instead of bubble wrap, and this is a process of continuous improvement for us. We are committed to further substantially reducing plastic in our packaging and are constantly innovating new solutions given the nature of our category. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                What is the range of locations to which Nykaa ships their products?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Nykaa does not ship internationally currently.
            </p>
            <h2>
                My order has been shipped. Now how can I track it?
            </h2>
            <p>
                After placing your order, you will receive a confirmation message on your registered email and phone number. As we prepare and ship your order within 24-48 hours of the confirmation, you can then check the status of your package through the 'Track' button on the 'My Orders' section. You can also choose to receive your order updates on WhatsApp. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                What is the estimated delivery time?
            </h2>
            <p>
                We usually dispatch most orders within 1-4 business days (excluding Sundays and public holidays)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Though, we keep 95% of our catalogue in our inventory, certain products need to be sourced directly from the brand itself so that we can live up to our promise of providing fresh, non-expired products. </li>
                <li>While we are trying our best to avoid this situation, these products might delay your order.</li>
                <li> If you are ordering our products from a Mega Sale event, dispatches may be a bit delayed due to increased volumes. We will target to dispatch all orders within 5 days of order date.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
                Are there any shipping charges applicable on my order?
